There are 5 kinds of watches each fan should possess. 

The year in watches used to be a quiet two-speed undertaking: enormous declarations in January and March (connecting to the yearly SIHH and Baselworld exchange fairs) caught up with various coincidental and exceptional dispatches (normally around commemorations and declarations). Every one of that has changed with the news that the two fairs will meet up in 2020 on another, coterminous date beginning in late April and enduring around ten days. 

How would I pick a men’s watch? 

1) Swiss brands are typically the most secure wagered 

On the off chance that the development in your programmed or mechanical timepiece is worked in-house by a significant Swiss marque, it’ll in all likelihood be of a superior quality than one which has been mass-delivered remotely. 

2) Check the carries for sharp edges 

In the event that the drags or instances of your watch include any sharp edges, the watch hasn’t been done appropriately and is a more extensive indication of poor production. 

3) Make sure you can swim with it 

Continuously settle on a watch which is - at any rate - water impervious to 50 meters. This doesn’t mean you can take your watch to a profundity of 50 meters, yet rather that you can swim with it typically. 

4) Invest in scratch-safe glass 

Attempt to pick a watch completed with scratch-safe sapphire gem glass. Anything less and the smallest slam will leave your watch in an extremely awful manner to be sure.
